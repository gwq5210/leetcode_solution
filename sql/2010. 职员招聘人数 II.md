# 2010. 职员招聘人数 II

题目链接：<https://leetcode.cn/problems/the-number-of-seniors-and-juniors-to-join-the-company-ii/description/>

## 思路

- 先按照高级低级，工资降序进行排序
- 然后用一个变量来统计每一行是否应该雇佣，并更新当前剩余的预算

```sql
with T as(
  select employee_id, experience, salary from Candidates order by experience, salary
)
select employee_id from (
select employee_id, IF(@curr_salary >= salary, 1, 0) as flag, @curr_salary := IF(@curr_salary >= salary, @curr_salary - salary, @curr_salary) as curr, salary from T, (select @curr_salary := 70000) tmp
) t where t.flag = 1
```
