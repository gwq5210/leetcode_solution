# 1699 两人之间的通话次数

## 使用group by和sum, count

- 由于题目要求person1 < person2，因此先将表进行归一化，保证from_id < to_id

```sql
select IF(from_id < to_id, from_id, to_id) as from_id, IF(from_id > to_id, from_id, to_id) as to_id, duration from Calls
```

- 然后在临时表上进行group by和统计

```sql
select a.from_id as person1, a.to_id as person2, count(*) as call_count, sum(a.duration) as total_duration from (select IF(from_id < to_id, from_id, to_id) as from_id, IF(from_id > to_id, from_id, to_id) as to_id, duration from Calls) a group by a.from_id, a.to_id
```

## group by临时字段

使用group by可以直接对临时字段进行分组

```sql
select 
    if(from_id<to_id,from_id,to_id) as person1,
    if(from_id<to_id,to_id,from_id) as person2,
    count(*) as call_count,
    sum(duration) as total_duration
from Calls c
group by person1,person2;
```
