# 580. 统计各专业学生人数

题目链接：<https://leetcode.cn/problems/count-student-number-in-departments/description/>

## 思路

先求出学生数量再连接
连接之后group by求学生数量

```sql
select d.dept_name, IFNULL(student_number, 0) as student_number from Department d left join (select dept_id, count(*) as student_number from Student group by dept_id) t on d.dept_id = t.dept_id order by student_number desc, d.dept_name asc;

SELECT
    dept_name, COUNT(student_id) AS student_number
FROM
    department
        LEFT OUTER JOIN
    student ON department.dept_id = student.dept_id
GROUP BY department.dept_name
ORDER BY student_number DESC , department.dept_name
;
```
