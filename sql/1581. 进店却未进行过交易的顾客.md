题目链接：<https://leetcode.cn/problems/customer-who-visited-but-did-not-make-any-transactions/description/>

## 使用子查询和not in、group by

```sql
select customer_id, count(*) count_no_trans from Visits where visit_id not in (select visit_id from Transactions) group by customer_id;
```

## 使用left join和group by

Visits表通过 visit_id 左连接Transactions表，找到消费amount为空，再通过消费者customer_id分组统计出数量。

```sql
select customer_id, count(*) count_no_trans from Visits left join Transactions on Visits.visit_id = Transactions.visit_id where amount is null group by Visits.customer_id;
```
