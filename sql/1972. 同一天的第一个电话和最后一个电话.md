# 1972. 同一天的第一个电话和最后一个电话

题目链接：<https://leetcode.cn/problems/first-and-last-call-on-the-same-day/>

## 思路一

题目要求拨打者和接听者都需要记录，因此我们先将数据进行归一化

```sql
(select caller_id, recipient_id, call_time from Calls)
union
(select recipient_id as caller_id, caller_id as recipient_id, call_time from Calls)
```

然后使用排名函数分别求出每个用户每天的第一个电话和最后一个电话，再连接进行判断是否满足条件

```sql
with C as (
(select caller_id, recipient_id, call_time from Calls)
union
(select recipient_id as caller_id, caller_id as recipient_id, call_time from Calls)
)
select distinct t.caller_id as user_id from (select caller_id, recipient_id, rank() over(partition by caller_id, date_format(call_time, '%Y-%m-%d') order by call_time) as ranking from C) t
join
(select caller_id, recipient_id, rank() over(partition by caller_id, date_format(call_time, '%Y-%m-%d') order by call_time desc) as ranking from C) u on t.ranking = 1 and u.ranking = 1 and t.caller_id = u.caller_id and t.recipient_id = u.recipient_id;
```
