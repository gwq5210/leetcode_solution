自连接或where

```sql
select distinct a.num as ConsecutiveNums from Logs a join Logs b on a.id = b.id - 1 and a.num = b.num join Logs c on a.id = c.id - 2 and a.num = c.num;

SELECT DISTINCT
    l1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM
    Logs l1,
    Logs l2,
    Logs l3
WHERE
    l1.Id = l2.Id - 1
    AND l2.Id = l3.Id - 1
    AND l1.Num = l2.Num
    AND l2.Num = l3.Num
;
