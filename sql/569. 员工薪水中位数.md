# 569. 员工薪水中位数

题目链接：<https://leetcode.cn/problems/median-employee-salary/description/>

## 思路

使用窗口函数排名，然后分情况求出中位数

```sql
with T as (
  select id, company, salary, count(*) over(partition by company) as company_count, row_number() over(partition by company order by salary) as ranking from Employee
)
select t2.id, t2.company, t2.salary from T t1 join T t2 on t1.company = t2.company and t1.ranking = 1 and t2.ranking = FLOOR(t1.company_count / 2) + 1
union
select t2.id, t2.company, t2.salary from T t1 join T t2 on t1.company = t2.company and t1.ranking = 1 and t2.ranking = FLOOR(t1.company_count / 2) and t1.company_count % 2 = 0 order by id, company;
```
