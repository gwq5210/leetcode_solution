# 1225. 报告系统状态的连续日期

题目链接：<https://leetcode.cn/problems/report-contiguous-dates/description/>

## 思路

为每个连续的区间生成唯一的id，group by id求出最大值和最小值

```sql
select 'failed' as period_state, min(status_date) as start_date, max(status_date) as end_date from
(select @id := IF(datediff(fail_date, @prev_date) = 1, @id, @id + 1) as id, @prev_date := fail_date as status_date from Failed, (select @id := 0, @prev_date = null) as temp where fail_date between '2019-01-01' and '2019-12-31') t
group by id
union
select 'succeeded' as period_state, min(status_date) as start_date, max(status_date) as end_date from
(select @id := IF(datediff(success_date, @prev_date) = 1, @id, @id + 1) as id, @prev_date := success_date as status_date from Succeeded, (select @id := 0, @prev_date = null) as temp where success_date between '2019-01-01' and '2019-12-31') t
group by id order by start_date

// 用窗口函数和subdate()来找到分组指标diff，后面就简单啦
with T as (
  select 'failed' as period_state, fail_date as status_date from Failed where fail_date between '2019-01-01' and '2019-12-31'
  union
  select 'succeeded' as period_state, success_date as status_date from Succeeded where success_date between '2019-01-01' and '2019-12-31'
)
select period_state, min(status_date) as start_date, max(status_date) as end_date from
(select period_state, status_date, subdate(status_date, row_number() over(partition by period_state order by status_date)) as diff from T t) t group by period_state, diff order by start_date
```
