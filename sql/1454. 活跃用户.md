## 思路

- 先去重
- 按照diff分组，求出连续的最大值和最小值
- 最大值和最小值差>=5的就是结果

```sql
with T as (
select id, diff, datediff(max(login_date), min(login_date)) + 1 as c from
(select id, login_date, subdate(login_date, row_number() over(partition by id order by login_date)) as diff from (select distinct id, login_date from Logins) t) t group by id, diff
)
select distinct a.id, a.name from T t join Accounts a on t.id = a.id where c >= 5 order by a.id;
```
