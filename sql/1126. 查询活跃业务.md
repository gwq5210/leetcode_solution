# 1126. 查询活跃业务

题目链接：<https://leetcode.cn/problems/active-businesses/description/>

## 思路

1. 先求出每个类型的平均值，然后join进行比较
2. 使用avg over窗口函数

```sql
select a.business_id from Events a join (select event_type, avg(occurences) as avg_count from Events group by event_type) b on a.event_type = b.event_type where a.occurences > b.avg_count group by a.business_id having count(*) >= 2;

select business_id from (select *, avg(occurences) over(partition by event_type) as avg_count from Events) t where occurences > avg_count group by business_id having count(*) >= 2;
```
