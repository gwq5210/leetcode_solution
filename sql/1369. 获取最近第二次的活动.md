## union

使用窗口函数查出每个用户的最近第二次活动，再查出只有一次用户活动，两者uoion

```sql
(select username, activity, startDate, endDate from (select *, rank() over(partition by username order by startDate desc) as ranking from UserActivity) t where t.ranking = 2)
union
(select username, activity, startDate, endDate from UserActivity group by username having count(*) = 1)
```

## rank窗口函数

使用两次窗口函数第一次求出最近前两个的活动，第二次按照日期升序获得第一个结果

```sql
select username, activity, startDate, endDate from (select username, activity, startDate, endDate, rank() over(partition by username order by startDate) as ranking from (select *, rank() over(partition by username order by startDate desc) as ranking from UserActivity) t where t.ranking <= 2) t where t.ranking = 1;
```

## rank和count窗口函数

用开窗，COUNT()加RANK()一起判断 如果只有一行的说明COUNT()是1，剩下的就是用RANK()为2即可拿到数据

```sql
select username, activity, startDate, endDate from (select *, rank() over(partition by username order by startDate desc) as ranking, count(*) over(partition by username) as num from UserActivity) t where t.ranking = 2 or t.num = 1;
```
