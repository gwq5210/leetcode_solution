## 思路

join之后，使用if进行求和

```sql
select p.player_id, p.player_name, sum(IF(c.Wimbledon = p.player_id, 1, 0)
+ IF(c.Fr_open = p.player_id, 1, 0)
+ IF(c.US_open = p.player_id, 1, 0)
+ IF(c.Au_open = p.player_id, 1, 0)
) as grand_slams_count from Players p join Championships c on p.player_id in (c.Wimbledon, c.Fr_open, c.US_open, c.Au_open) group by p.player_id;
```
