## join、group by和having

- 统计经理的直接下属，可以直接对managerId进行group by
- group by之后只能获取到managerId
- 想要获取到name，需要对子表进行连接或者直接使用in

```sql
select name from Employee e join (select managerId from Employee group by managerId having count(*) >= 5) t on e.id = t.managerId;

select name
from `employee`
where id in
(
    select managerid
    from `employee`
    group by `managerid` having count(*) >= 5
);
```
